								To summarise and make the most of the opportunities presented by failed projects, we must adopt a positive mindset,
								 embrace accountability, foster collaboration, maintain perspective, and take proactive steps towards improvement. 
								 We must also take full responsibility for our projects' outcomes, acknowledge strengths and weaknesses and 
								 consistently maintain a growth mindset (Magarey, 2017). 
								This requires a relentless focus on enhancing processes and reevaluating assumptions to minimise errors in future projects.</p>
							<p>I learnt there three main reasons for project failure: unclear goals, scope creep, and poor communication, answering the first question, ‘What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?’. These factors can lead to an unsuccessful project, so it is important to keep them in mind when planning any project (Kissflow, 2020).
								Lehtinen et al. (2014) study provides valuable insights into project failures and also equips us with practical strategies that are designed to be easily implementable, giving us the confidence to steer our projects towards success. Ascertra (2017) notes that the PMI study reveals ineffective communication hurts project execution. Therefore, it is recommended that communication be improved by tailoring it to stakeholder groups and implementing standardised practices. Additionally, project failure can occur for various reasons but still result in significant consequences. To avoid it, it is essential to set clear objectives, define scope creep, set SMART goals, allocate limited resources, and ensure proper communication (MacNeil, 2022).

								Question 1: What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?
								<br>
								<br>

									The study by Lihtinen et al. (2014) specifies miscommunication, weak job backlog

									management, and poor software tester resources as the main reasons for project

									failure. Communication gaps lead to accidents when one person tries to do another job and that

									desired result is not achieved due to conflicts in viewpoints and judgment priorities. When the

									clarity of job backlog management is not strong, ambivalent task priorities and delays usually

									occur; thus, the pace might slow down. However, unplanned software testing resources, such as

									inadequate quality management, bugs, and entire projects, may get exposed. The preceding

									factors illustrate that project management is a complex undertaking and involves critical areas

									that are prone to error, which therefore need the implantation of mitigating measures to enhance

									the success rates of projects.
									<br>
									<br>

								Question 2: Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several

								examples in the lecturecast).
								<br>
								<br>

								For example, miscommunication may occur through misinterpretation of the client

								requirements by developers, which may cause the product to be unable to be used as expected.

								Poor project backlog management may have the consequence of critical tasks being skipped over

								or ignored, and consequently, the timeliness of the project may be forfeited and the budget may

								expand. Moreover, a generic cause of software testing inadequacy could be insufficient testing

								resources necessitating a substandard quality assessment process and unreliable software releases

								due to a deficiency in user satisfaction. This is a vivid film, and these examples show how a lack

								of communication, weak job backlog management, and insufficient software testing resources

								can fail a project.
